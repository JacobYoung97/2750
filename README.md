# 2750
This is the final code for CIS*2750 from University of Guelph. The Angel of Death course. 

Final grade = 82%. Assignment grade = 28.75/40 (mainly because of A1's 1/10 grade)

The code in this repository is for A4 which was the final version of the project.
The HTML that it creates is not structured with CSS or JavaScript to make it look nicer and perform differently (as of June 28, 2017).

Languages used during creation:
C, "C++", Python, PHP, HTML, SQL (embedded in C)

*********************************

Possible future additions:
"Easy": add css stylesheet to be included at the <head> </head> and/or a title for the webpages
	-this can be added as a secondary file on the command line to execute the program that creates the webpages

"Easy": change the file structure to better organize the files with src/ , include/ , docs/ , and possible css or javascript later
	-will need to change where programs are called in every file

"Medium": add javascript functionality either from a script file on the command line or embedded in the tags (would need some more if-statements)
